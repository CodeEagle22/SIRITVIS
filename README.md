Social Interaction Research Insights Topic Visualization

## Summary   

The integration of the SIRITVIS Python package offers a robust and scientifically grounded approach for getting insights of data from platforms like Twitter and Reddit. It provides a comprehensive set of features including data streaming, preprocessing, model training, topic evaluation metrics, topic distribution and graph visualisation, and geo-visualization tools. By leveraging these capabilities, organizations can gain valuable insights into the spatial distribution of topics and make data-driven decisions.

The package combines established methodologies from data science, machine learning, and geospatial analysis, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the results. Rigorous preprocessing techniques and model training enhance the validity of the extracted topics, while scientifically validated evaluation metrics assess their quality and relevance. The geo-visualization tools enable clear and intuitive understanding of the spatial distribution of topics.

Overall, the adoption of the SIRITVIS package empowers organizations across domains such as marketing, politics, and disaster management to deepen their understanding of customers and stakeholders. By leveraging spatial topic distribution insights, they can enhance engagement and facilitate informed decision-making processes, leading to improved outcomes.

## Features

- Data Streaming üíæ
- Data Cleaning üßπ
- Topic Model Training and Evaluation :dart:
- Topic Visual Insights üîç
- Twitter Topic Geo Visualisation üåè

## üõ† Installation

Attention: SIRITVIS is designed to run on Python 3.10, it has been fully tested under these conditions. We recommend installing a new (conda) environment using Python 3.10.10 for optimal compatibility and performance.

The package can be installed via pip:

```bash
cd ../dist
pip install SIRITVIS-1.0.tar.gz
```

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage ([documentation])

Import Libraries

```python
from SIRITVIS import reddit_streamer, cleaner, topic_model, topic_visualise, tweet_mapper
```

### Streaming Reddit Data

```python
client_id = "XXXXXXXXXX"
client_secret = "XXXXXXXXX"
user_agent = "XXXXXXXXXX"
keywords = ['Specific','Keywords']
save_path = '../folder/path/to/store/the/data/'
raw_data = reddit_streamer.RedditStreamer(client_id,client_secret,user_agent,save_path,keywords).run()
```

### Cleaning Reddit, Twitter or Any External Text Data

```python
# raw_data variable could also used as load_path attribute value

clean_data = cleaner.Cleaner(load_path='../folder/path/or/csv/file/path/to/load/data/',data_save_name='twitter',data='twitter')

cleaned_file = clean_data.saving('../folder/path/to/store/the/cleaned/data/')
```

### Train your a topic model on a corpus of short texts

```python
# cleaned_file variable could also used as dataset_path attribute value

model = topic_model.TopicModeling(num_topics=10, dataset_path='../csv/file/path/to/load/data.csv',
learning_rate=0.001, batch_size=32, activation='softplus', num_layers=3, num_neurons=100,
dropout=0.2, num_epochs=100, save_model=False, model_path=None, train_model='NeuralLDA')

saved_model = model.run()
```

### Topic Insights Visualisation 

To investigate internal structure of topics and their relations to words and indicidual documents we recommend using [pyLDAvis](https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis).
```python
# cleaned_file variable could also used as file_path attribute value

vis_model = topic_visualise.PyLDAvis(file_path='../csv/file/path/to/load/data.csv',text_column='text')
vis_model.visualize()
```

To investigate internal structure of topics and their relations to words and indicidual documents we recommend using [topicwizard]
```python
# cleaned_file variable could also used as csv_file attribute value

vis_model = topic_visualise.TopicWizardvis(csv_file='../csv/file/path/to/load/data.csv',num_topics=5,text_column='text')
vis_model.visualize()
```
(https://github.com/x-tabdeveloping/topic-wizard).

### Twitter Topic Geo Visualisation 
(under production)

```python
csv_file_path = '../file/path/of/data.csv'
model_file = '../file/path/of/model.pkl'
tweet_mapper.TweetMapper(csv_file_path,model_file)
```
## Community guidelines
Contributions to SIRITVIS are welcome.

Just file an Issue to ask questions, report bugs, or request new features.
Pull requests via GitHub are also welcome.
Potential contributions include ways to further improve the quality of the topics of topic models in handling the noisy Reddit and Twitter data and an improvement of the tweet_mapper function in a way that it becomes independent form the notebook.
